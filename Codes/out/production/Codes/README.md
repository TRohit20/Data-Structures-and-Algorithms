# Codes
Programming practise 

Hey everyone. This is a repository that contains the source codes with all the synatxes commented and some of the codes that I add moving forward 
will have the methodology like identifying the patterns and solving the problems. 
Hope you find it useful. 
Will be uploading my personally curated JAVA notes.
