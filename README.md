Hi everybody, This repository consists of Notes of Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Code samples with explanations through comments.

Notes can be used for anyone just starting out to someone on the go for a quick review before technical interviews. 
Anything to correct or contribute? Feel free to send a pull request!
I will continue to update this repository with my learnings and resources from time to time.

Thanks. Have a great time! ;)
